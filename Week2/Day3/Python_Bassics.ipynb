        "1. Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.​\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its ease of learning and flexibility.​\n",
        "\n",
        "3. It has become extremely popular in various fields, including data analysis, web development, and machine learning​\n",
        "\n",
        "4. There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key features:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Easy to Learn and Use:** Python's syntax is clear and intuitive, making it an excellent language for beginners. Its syntax is often described as almost like writing in English, which reduces the learning curve for new programmers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Interpreted Language:** Unlike compiled languages, Python code is executed line by line, making debugging easier and more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **High-Level Language:** Python abstracts many details of the computer's operating system, allowing programmers to focus more on programming logic rather than system specifics.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Extensive Standard Library:** Python comes with a large standard library that includes modules for various tasks, from web development to data analysis, reducing the need for external libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Dynamic Typing:** Python is dynamically typed, meaning that the type of a variable is checked during runtime, which provides flexibility in coding.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Portability:** Python code can run on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix, with little to no modificatio"
